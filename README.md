# Smoke_test
This test contains the basic test cases on PAS,NAS and CPS.

# Requirements
DHCP server should be enabled for the switch to get the management IP
Outside connectivity should be there to install all the packages from bintray

# Files for ansible
ansible.cfg- Configuration file for ansible
hosts- Hosts file to manage the hosts with hostname, userid and password/key

# Folder structure and Explanation
site.yml - This yml file calls all the yml files to install OPX NOS and run smoke test
roles/check_opx_onie - This role contains the yml file to check whether the switch in OPX prompt or ONIE prompt, if in OPX prompt it will execute 
                       onie_img_install role. It will install the OPX NOS.
roles/onie_img_install - This role assumes the switch in OPX prompt, reboot the switch and bring to ONIE prompt. After it comes to ONIE prompt, it will 
                         execute check_opx_onie role to install OPX NOS
roles/pkg_install - This role will install all the packages NAS, PAS and CPS.
roles/opx_smoke_test- This will run the smoke test to test PAS,NAS and CPS

# Variable files
roles/check_opx_onie/vars/main.yml - This file contains the variables for the role check_opx_onie
roles/opx_smoke_test/vars/opx_vars.yml - This file contains the variables for the role opx_smoke_test

# Topology
The smoke test runs on the single node/swtich.

# Playbook functions
- Playbook(check_opx_onie role) will check whether the switch in ONIE prompt or OPX prompt. 
- If the switch in ONIE prompt(check_opx_onie role), it will uninstall the existing OS and install OPX.
- If the switch in OPX prompt(onie_img_install role), it will reboot the switch to ONIE, uninstall the existing OS and install OPX
- After the OPX is installed, it will install the packages using "apt-get install opx-dell-s6000" and reboot the switch
- Once the switch is up, opx_smoke_test will be triggered to run the smoke test

# Smoke Test Test Cases

- Disable the logging on to syslog
- Dump the management interface
- Dump the kernel routing table
- Check the opx-cps service is up
- Check the redis-server service is up
- Check the opx-pas service is up
- Check the opx-nas service is up
- Check the number of ports present with respect to the platform
- CPS get on the base-pas entity to check platform-related entities
- CPS get on the base-pas chassis to check burned MAC address
- Check the opx-acl-init service is up
- Check the opx-qos-init service is up
- Configure static route from kernel using "ip route" and check the route is programmed on the kernel
- CPS get on NAS to check whether the static route gets programmed on NAS
- Unconfiguring the static route in kernel
- Configure static MAC entry with VLAN using CPS Set
- Verify the MAC entry is present in NAS by using CPS Get
- Delete the static MAC entry with VLAN using CPS Set
- Verify the MAC entry is deleted in NAS by using CPS Get
- Add VLAN with untagged ports using CPS Set
- Verify VLAN with untagged ports on NAS using CPS Get
- Update the untagged ports on VLAN using CPS Set
- Verify the VLAN with updated ports on NAS using CPS Get
- Delete the VLAN using CPS set
- Verify the VLAN is removed from NAS using CPS Get
- Verify the system is up and running using systemctl is-system-running
- Verify the failed services using systemctl --all --state=failed list-units
- Dump the packages installed using apt-list --installed
- Verify the power supply, fan, and so on using opx-show-env which uses CPS Get
- Verify the media/optics present on the system using opx-show-transceivers which uses CPS Get

# How to run smoke test

1. Download ansible in any server/laptop(see Ansible Installation).
2. Edit the hosts file with the details on management IP, username, password/key (For ONIE, there needs to be seperate host with username as root, check the   sample hosts file)
3. Run the playbook with the command where 'hostname' is the hostname for OPX installation from ONIE, IMG_LOCATION is the location where the OPX image is located and IMG_NAME is the name of the file which is copied to the tmp directory of ONIE

     'ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts --extra-vars "IMG_LOCATION=http://dell-networking.bintray.com/opx-images/opx-onie-installer_1.1_amd64.bin IMG_NAME=opx_image hostname=ONIE_Leaf1" -vv'

see opx-test for all the files.
